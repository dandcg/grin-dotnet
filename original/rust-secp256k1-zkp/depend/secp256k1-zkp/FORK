Forked from https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp

The forked repository is tracked into a branch called 'vendor'. The master
branch of this repository contains our modifications on top of that. To
update from upstream (note that oddly, secp256k1-zkp has no master, the
default branch is called like the repository):

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp
		git checkout vendor
		git pull upstream secp256k1-zkp
		git push origin vendor
		git checkout master
		git merge vendor
		git push
